WooCommerce Catalog Mode is the most efficient plugin to transform your WooCommerce shop into an online catalog.

== Description ==

WooCommerce Catalog Mode (previously known as ***Hide Price and Add to Cart Button for WooCommerce***) is the most effective WooCommerce extension to transform your online shop into an online catalog of products.

<a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ps-hide-price-and-add-to-cart-for-woocommerce/?preview=1" target="_blank">Demo</a> -  You can preview the complete plugin functionality in the WordPress Playground using the Live Preview button.

There are several reasons behind activating the WooCommerce Catalog Mode on your store and disabling sales. 

For example, you may want to hide the Price and the Add to Cart Button for the following scenarios:

&#9989; Only registered and logged-in customers can view the prices of products or use the Add to Cart button on your WooCommerce store.
&#9989; You are going on vacation and want to disable the sales and order backlog during the period.
&#9989; You want to replace the price for guest users with an effective CTA like *Login/Sign Up to view the price*.
&#9989; You want to hide the price of a particular product from your competitors. 

Let us see how this WooCommerce Catalog Mode extension can help you to achieve all these, and more.

###&#127917; Catalog Mode for Guest Users

Head over to the plugin settings if you want to hide the Product Prices and the Add to Cart Button only for guest users. 

Select the appropriate checkboxes. The plugin will take care of the rest. 

All your registered users can view the Prices and the Add to Cart Button. But, this WooCommerce catalog mode plugin will hide it for guest or unregistered users.

###üèñÔ∏è Catalog Mode for all users  (Store Vacation) 

You can hide the prices and the Add to Cart Button for guests. You can hide these for registered users. This will disable sales while you set your store in Vacation Mode.

The plugin will ensure you do not receive orders while you enjoy your vacation.

###&#127919; Show Prices but Hide the Add to Cart Button

The plugin can display only the prices but hide the Add to Cart Button. 

Toggle the plugin checkboxes and save the settings if you wish.

###&#127919; Replace the Price with a Custom Text

This WooCommerce Catalog Mode extension also allows you to hide the prices of products and replace them with custom text.

###&#127919; Hide the Sale Badge 

This WooCommerce Catalog Mode extension can also hide the Sale Badge of products. Again, you can achieve this by toggling a checkbox. 

###&#127919; WooCommerce Catalog Mode
